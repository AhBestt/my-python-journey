# Variables
Learn to store values in containers for later use. Variables is a concept in programming that allows us to give a label to a piece of data so that we can refer or reference that data using the chosen variable name. <br>
We will see in this lesson how to create variables and how to use the variables to access the contained value. <br> 

### Task1: Check the length of the user input <br>
Using what you have learnt about the len() function and the input() function. Try to print out the number of characters in the user input. <br>
Write everything in just 1 line of code. <br>

original code:
```bash
input("What is your name?")
```

### Task2: Split everything into variables <br>
Split each step in the previous exercise into a seperate variable. One variable called username and one called length. <br>
Use the variable username in the len calculation
